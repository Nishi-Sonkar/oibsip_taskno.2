    <h2>Biography</h2>
   <p>Einstein was born at Ulm, in Württemberg, Germany, on March 14, 1879. 
 Six weeks later the family moved to Munich, where he later on began his 
        schooling at the Luitpold Gymnasium. Later, they moved to Italy and Albert 
        continued his education at Aarau, Switzerland and in 1896 he entered the Swiss
         Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich to be trained as a teacher in physics 
         and mathematics. 
         In 1901, the year he gained his diploma, he acquired Swiss
          citizenship and, as he was unable to find a teaching post, he accepted a 
          position as technical assistant in the Swiss Patent Office.
           In 1905 he obtained his doctor’s degree.
              During his stay at the Patent Office, and in his spare time, 
        he produced much of his remarkable work and in 1908 he was appointed 
        Privatdozent in Berne.
       In 1914 he was appointed Director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Physical Institute and Professor in the University of
         Berlin.</p>
